# PLIB - Palm's C Utility Library

This library contains various modules providing functionality that I either
needed for some personal project, or that I was curious about and wanted to
implement myself.

Each module is completely independent, not sharing code with any other module,
with one exception. The unit tests of all modules depend on the `unit` module,
which provides a simple unit testing framework.

All modules are subject to the MIT license.
